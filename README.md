Hi there, welcome to my site!

My name is Yi, also can call me Eason.

I study for full-stack web development, and I use Javascript/HTML/CSS with Bootstrap to build up the website as my e-resume.

Here within the site I tried to wrap up some ideas of the project I have participated or accomplished.

I love coding, for the time being have several years experience in Java, Python, C/C++, Matlab and some other computer languages development. 

I enjoy the new challenges also from data science, machine learning and artificial intelligence. These are really awesome inspirations that how tech can change our world.

I am always looking forward to learn new skills, meet with new people, and make great things happen.

Hope you will like it!
